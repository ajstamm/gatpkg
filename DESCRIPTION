Description: The purpose of this package is to run the New York State 
    Department of Health’s Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) in R. GAT takes 
    an input shapefile and aggregates polygons based on user-defined numeric 
    values, then returns the new shapefile, the old shapefile with a crosswalk 
    attached, and other diagnostic information. See the vignettes and the 
    functions' help documentation for more details on how GAT works.
