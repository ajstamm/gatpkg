<p>The Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) generates and saves several
files in the save folder defined by the user. Generated files
include:</p>
<p><strong>Log:</strong> The log includes all of your settings and a
brief list of variables created by GAT, including a data dictionary for
the GATflag variable, which corresponds with the highlighted areas
displayed in the plots.</p>
<p><strong>PDF of plots:</strong> The plots may also indicate potential
issues in your merge, depending on the selections you made. If relevant,
the plots will highlight the following geographic areas that are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excluded by the user</li>
<li>Below the minimum aggregation value</li>
<li>Above the maximum aggregation value</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the compactness ratio plot will display a lighter color
for areas with low compactness ratios.</p>
<p><strong>Crosswalk shapefile and associated DBF:</strong> The
crosswalk shapefile, which ends with “*in.shp”, is identical to your
input file with a few variables added to the table by GAT. These
variables are noted in the log. Note the variable GATflag, which
identifies any areas excluded by the aggregation process.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregated shapefile and associated DBF:</strong> The
aggregated shapefile is your final product. The variable GATid links the
crosswalk and aggregated shapefiles. Again, note the variable
GATflag.</p>
<p><strong>Optionally, aggregated KML file:</strong> This file will only
be written if you request it and is not used in assessment.</p>

<h2 id="figuring-out-why-areas-were-flagged">Figuring out why areas were flagged<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#figuring-out-why-areas-were-flagged"></a>
</h2>
<p>If you notice highlighted areas in places you do not expect, there
are a few things you can do. First, review your settings. Note
especially aggregation minimum and maximum values, exclusion criteria,
and boundary settings. All basic settings are written to the log. In
addition, the advanced setting <code>adjacent = TRUE</code> in the
function options for <code><a href="../reference/runGATprogram.html">runGATprogram()</a></code> may cause unexpected
behavior. These will be covered in the next few subsections.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="areas-excluded-by-the-user">Areas excluded by the user<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areas-excluded-by-the-user"></a>
</h3>
<p>These areas meet one or more of the exclusion criteria you provided.
They will be highlighted in <strong><span style="color: CornflowerBlue;">blue-grey</span></strong> on the plots
and labeled “1” in the variable GATflag in both shapefiles. Check that
the areas you excluded are the areas you expected to exclude. Refer to
the log or to the subtitles in the choropleth plots to verify how you
defined your exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>GAT has no mechanism to include areas that meet some, but not all,
exclusion criteria. For more complex exclusion rules, you should create
a numeric Boolean flag (e.g. 0 = true/include, 1 = false/exclude) prior
to running your shapefile through GAT. Then use that Boolean flag as
your exclusion variable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="areas-above-maximum-aggregation-value">Areas above maximum aggregation value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areas-above-maximum-aggregation-value"></a>
</h3>
<p>These areas had a value higher than your maximum value for <em>one or
both</em> of your aggregation variables. They will be highlighted in
<strong><span style="color: magenta;">magenta</span></strong> on the
plots and labeled “5” in the variable GATflag in both shapefiles. Check
that the areas highlighted are those you expected to have high
values.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="areas-below-minimum-aggregation-value">Areas below minimum aggregation value<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areas-below-minimum-aggregation-value"></a>
</h3>
<p>These areas may have aggregated at least once. However, they did not
aggregate enough to meet your minimum aggregation value for one or both
aggregation variables. They will be highlighted in <strong><span style="color: cyan;">cyan</span></strong> on the plots and labeled “10”
in the variable GATflag in the aggregated shapefile. In general, any
areas with GATflag = 10 are problematic. Some of the situations that
cause variables to be flagged are listed below, followed by ways to
address these situations.</p>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="causes">Causes<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#causes"></a>
</h4>
<p>An area fails to aggregate to the minimum value because it has no
neighbors eligible for aggregation. This is especially common if you use
the <code>adjacent = TRUE</code> setting because it forces areas to
aggregate only to areas that it physically touches.</p>
<p>If you used <code>adjacent = TRUE</code>, which is the default
setting in <code><a href="../reference/runGATprogram.html">runGATprogram()</a></code>, these situations can all cause
areas to fail to aggregate to the minimum value. These situations hold
true both within enforced boundaries (when an area cannot merge to areas
outside its boundary at all) and when boundaries are not used.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The area is an island. It is not physically touching any other
areas.</li>
<li>The area is isolated by excluded areas. For example, the area is the
tip of a peninsula, but you excluded the peninsula’s base or merging
with the peninsula’s base would cause the resulting area to surpass the
maximum value for one or both aggregation variables.</li>
<li>The area is at the edge of the boundary and neighbors are not
eligible. The area may be unable to merge to neighbors because they are
excluded or because merging with them would cause the resulting area to
surpass the maximum value for one or both aggregation variables.</li>
<li>The largest possible area is smaller than the minimum aggregation
value. This occurs most commonly when using enforced boundaries, when
all areas within the boundary merge into a single area, but the total
for that area is still smaller than the minimum aggregation value for
one or both aggregation variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you manually set <code>adjacent = FALSE</code>, #4 above may still
occur. In addition, a fifth situation is possible.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>All neighbors within the boundary either were excluded or have high
enough values for one or both aggregation variables that merging with
them would cause one or both aggregation values in the resulting area to
exceed the maximum aggregation values.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level4">
<h4 id="solutions">Solutions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#solutions"></a>
</h4>
<p>Inspect the areas that were flagged and consider which issues above
apply to your data. Review which settings are essential and which could
be modified, including the merge method. The solutions you choose depend
largely on your available shapefiles and your ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Most of these issues could be addressed in one of four ways. Whether
any or all of these solutions are appropriate depends on what you are
trying to do. You may want to try a few of them before settling on a
final solution.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use a shapefile with contiguous areas. Shapefiles that include
cutouts for rivers, lakes, and shorelines are more likely to cause
problems with aggregation, especially when using
<code>adjacent = TRUE</code>.</li>
<li>If you do not need contiguous aggregated areas, use
<code>adjacent = FALSE</code>. This is not recommended in most cases,
but it may be appropriate for your data and purpose.</li>
<li>Relax boundary restrictions. If you checked the box to enforce
boundaries, but your task does not absolutely require that you remain
within boundaries, try running the aggregation without checking that
box. If you defined a boundary, GAT will still try to merge within that
boundary before looking for neighbors outside it.</li>
<li>Increase or remove the restriction for maximum aggregation value.
Consider the highest acceptable value or try running the aggregation
without defining maximum aggregation values. After aggregation is
complete, check the log for the ranges of values for each aggregation
variable before and after aggregating.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="areas-with-low-compactness-ratio">Areas with low compactness ratio<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#areas-with-low-compactness-ratio"></a>
</h3>
<p>These areas may include long, narrow shapes or windy shapes that look
like spiders or snakes. They can be identified using the compactness
ratio map. In this map, areas with a low compactness ratio (longer or
stringier, or sometimes donut loops) will be a lighter color than areas
with a high compactness ratio (rounder or more square). For a
description of compactness ratio, review the final section in the <a href="../doc/gat_tech_notes.html">Technical Notes</a>.</p>
<p>Compactness ratio may be important for your project. If so,
aggregating to geographic centroids using the function option
<code>adjacent = TRUE</code> is the most likely merge method to result
in highly compact areas.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="post-processing">Post-processing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#post-processing"></a>
</h2>
<p>This two-part process is optional. Your goal here is to create the
final crosswalk file and address any flagged areas. If your aggregation
has two steps (see example below), the first part of post-processing is
to create a master crosswalk that contains both the original and the
final area IDs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>You wish to aggregate census tracts within each county to a specific
population. However, for counties with populations below your minimum,
you wish to aggregate those counties to other counties within each
state.</p>
<p>This would require you to run the aggregation twice. First, you would
process your shapefile with the boundary set to county. Then you would
process the aggregated shapefile from the previous step with the
boundary set to state. Afterward, you would run the included function
<code>combineGATcrosswalk()</code>. This function combines the crosswalk
tables from the first and second aggregations and assigns the combined
table to the original crosswalk shapefile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the second part of this process, run project-specific code to
handle any areas that were still flagged after selecting the final
aggregation settings. This code may include redefining GATid for flagged
areas in the original crosswalk and reaggregating all areas based on the
revised GATid variable to create final crosswalk and aggregation
shapefiles.</p>
