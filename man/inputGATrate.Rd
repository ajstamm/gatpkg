\usage{
inputGATrate(
  mapdata,
  defaultopt = 0,
  help = "There is no help for you.",
  limitdenom = TRUE,
  step = 9,
  ratevars = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{mapdata}{The data frame from which to select variables.}

\item{defaultopt}{An integer that notes which initial list item should be
highlighted.}

\item{help}{A text string containing the help message.}

\item{limitdenom}{A boolean denoting whether to limit the denominator to
only variables without zeroes or missings before
aggregation.}

\item{step}{Integer step in the GAT program, for help reference.}

\item{ratevars}{Rate settings, if pre-defined.}

\item{backopt}{Boolean denoting whether to include the back button.}
}
\description{
This function opens a dialog window for the user to select the settings to
calculate the rate for a map, if so desired. The dialog window looks like
this.

\figure{inputGATrate.png}

\emph{Figure: Dialog to select your rate settings}

Select your desired rate settings. If you do not want to calculate a rate,
check the box at the top. If you do want to calculate a rate, sselect the
desired numerator, denominator, and color scheme from the drop-down lists.
Name your rate something other than "no_rate", the flag that tells GAT a
rate should not be calculated. Then click on one of the following buttons.
\itemize{
\item Click \code{Next} to continue to the next step.
\item Click \code{Cancel} to end GAT.
\item Click \code{Back} to return to the previous step.
\item Click \code{Help} to get further guidance and open this manual.
}
}
\details{
Change the limitdenom option from FALSE to TRUE in step 9 (requesting rate
calculation information) in \code{\link{runGATprogram}} if you want to
allow only denominators with finite, non-zero values.

This function returns a list with the following elements:

\itemize{\bold{ratename: }
What to call the rate. The default is "gat_rate". If the user chooses not
to calculate a rate, the value is set to "no_rate" to indicate that rate
calculations should not be done later. This variable also holds the value
for "back" or "cancel", if the user selects one of those.
}
\itemize{\bold{numerator: }
The name of the numerator variable for the rate.
}
\itemize{\bold{denominator: }
The name of the denominator variable for the rate.
}
\itemize{\bold{multiplier: }
The number by which to multiply the rate. If the user includes commas,
they will be removed.
}
\itemize{\bold{colorscheme: }
The ColorBrewer color scheme to use when mapping the rate later.
}
\itemize{\bold{colorname: }
The formal name of the selected ColorBrewer color scheme.
}
