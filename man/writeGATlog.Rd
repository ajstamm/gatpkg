\usage{
writeGATlog(
  area = NULL,
  gatvars = NULL,
  aggvars = NULL,
  filevars = NULL,
  mysettings = NULL,
  mergevars = NULL,
  ratevars = NULL,
  exclist = NULL,
  settingsfile = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{area}{Spatial layer.}

\item{gatvars}{List of objects created by GAT. See the example for
the elements it contains.}

\item{aggvars}{List of objects created by the aggregation process.
See mergeGATpolygons() for the elements created.}

\item{filevars}{List of file names and paths. Of relevance to this
function are the filename, filein, and the combined save
path and save name, userout.}

\item{mysettings}{List of system settings, including version, pkgdate,
starttime, and the booleans savekml and exists.}

\item{mergevars}{List of settings for the aggregation. See the example
for the elements it contains.}

\item{ratevars}{List of settings for calculating rate. See the example
for the elements it contains.}

\item{exclist}{List of exclusion criteria to use when merging.}

\item{settingsfile}{R data file (*.Rdata) produced as part of GAT's output.
This file saves all settings for GAT. Other options can
be set to NULL only if this option is defined.

Notes on using the settingsfile option:
\enumerate{
\item You will get an error if you moved the input shapefile before running
the function with this option, since the function needs to access the
input shapefile to recreate the log.
\item Reading in an *.Rdata file from a previous version of GAT may result in
incorrect elapsed time and GAT version numbers being written to the log,
or in errors that cause the file to be incomplete, due to changes in
settings saved to the *.Rdata file as GAT has evolved.
}}
}
\description{
This function writes a log of the aggregation process. It reports the
input and output datasets, variables and settings used, distributions of
aggregation variables, map projection, program start and end times, and
any warnings that were generated.
