Description: The purpose of this package is to run the New York State 
    Department of Health (NYSDOH)  Environmental Public Health Tracking 
    Geographic Aggregation Tool (GAT) in R. GAT takes an input shapefile and 
    aggregates polygons based on user-defined numeric values, then returns 
    the new shapefile, the old shapefile with a crosswalk attached, and 
    other diagnostic information. See the vignettes and the functions' help 
    documentation for more details on how GAT works.
