# Archive for historical information on GAT's development

This folder contains prior versions of GAT prior to converting GAT to an R package. These files are provided for historical use only and are no longer being maintained or supported. The only version of GAT that we support currently is the R package. If you have questions about GAT's history, please email epht@health.ny.gov.

## GAT for R

This script was written by Gwen Babcock with documentation by Gwen Babcock and Tom Talbot. Version 1.34 was released on August 28, 2015. The original release also included zipped versions of R and all required packages. The download here contains only the script and documentation. This version of GAT contained the following features: 

* aggregate by geographic centroid
* aggregate by similar areas (ratio of two values)
* calculate a rate/ratio
* enter minimum value for up to two variables
* save results as shapefile and KML file

The script was designed to run in R versions 2.9-3.0 and may run in later versions, but that has not been tested. It required the following packages: tcltk, stats, graphics, grDevices, utils, datasets, methods, base, Matrix_1.0-12, lattice_0.20-15, rgdal_0.8-10, foreign_0.8-53, svDialogs_0.9-54, svGUI_0.9-54, classInt_0.1-20, e1071_1.6-1, class_7.3-8, RColorBrewer_1.0-5, maptools_0.8-26, rgeos_0.2-19, sp_1.0-11, boot_1.3-9, coda_0.16-1, deldir_0.0-22, grid_3.0.1, LearnBayes_2.12, MASS_7.3-26, nlme_3.1-109, spdep_0.5-62, splines_3.0.1

## Previous versions of the GAT package for R

In 2019, Abigail Stamm began transitioning GAT to an R package. For a full list of authors and acknowledgements, please see the package documentation. The first public version was 1.61.0, released in August 2020 when this repository went live. Versioning for the package began with 1.35, to remain consistent with the original R script.
