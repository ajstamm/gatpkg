Changes for V3?
* Add ability to use point level population-weighting data, and possibly raster
* Add compatibility with linux/unix - need workaround for Windows-specific choose.files function when locating shapefiles
* Add a way (or vignette?) to bypass the GUI entirely

To keep in mind:
* if I want to zip shapefiles, use the code `unz()` to unzip and read them
  * this would bypass the "2022 DBF is an executable" bug
* Where I alter par settings for maps, dev.off reverts to default - is this desired?
* tibble causes trouble - imported random function as temporary fix
* Create function to handle progress bar drawing? Lots of repeated code.
* Also, buttons at bottoms of dialogs repeated - shift to function?

Examples to create:
* combineGATcrosswalks

Fixes and improvements to address:
* Streamline warnings
* Add any "old_*" variables created/renamed to the log
* For all vignettes and help files, check image alt/descriptions
  * tutorial completed through end of user input section (except help, quit, errors)
  * redo all user input screenshots
* convert spdep and maptools to sf? note: spdep works with sf
* basic geographic aggregation miscalculates values over min, so nothing aggregates


Completed - test
	* runGATprogram (rgdal, sp, maptools)
		- last (convert & test all functions, then combine everything here)
		- to test:
		  - error triggers
		  - randomly deleting progress bar
		- step 3: I think the flagging & variable naming codes are redundant

Completed - create examples
	* combineGATcrosswalks (rgdal)
		- export datasets to use as examples
		- or create datasets as part of examples?

Completed - divorce spdep?
	* aggregateGATnb (spdep) - find sf equivalent?
	* defineGATmerge (sp, spdep) - find sf equivalent?

Completed - these output layers - wait to copy
	* weightGATmap (sp structure)
	* mergeGATareas (sp, maptools)
	* rankGATdistance (sp)
	* identifyGATfirstobs (sp structure)
	* importGATweights (sp)
	* calculateGATexclusions (sf structure)
	* calculateGATcompactness (sp, rgeos)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)
	* createGATregion (sp)
	* zzz
	  - hftown & hfpop converted
	  - new aggregated and crosswalk objects created

Completed - none of these output layers - copy to master now?
	* writeGATlog (rgdal)
	* weightGATregion (sp structure)
	* convertlatlong2UTM (sp)
	* plotGATmaps (sp)
	* writeGATkml (sp)
	* plotGATcompare (sp)
	* checkGATvariabletypes
